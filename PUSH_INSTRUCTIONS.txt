Since this environment doesn't have git available to push directly to GitHub, run the following commands locally on your machine to add the project to GitHub:

1. In a terminal at the project root:

   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit - Teacher attendance app"

2. Add your GitHub remote (replace URL if needed):

   git remote add origin https://github.com/kishore999-hash/Student-Attendance-Maker-And-Sharable.git

3. Push to GitHub (main branch):

   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main

If you get authentication errors, use a Personal Access Token (PAT) or set up SSH keys. If you want, I can generate a minimal GitHub Actions workflow file that builds the client and deploys to GitHub Pages on push.
